# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! 🚀 This space is dedicated to documenting my progress, projects, and insights as I explore the world of Python programming.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository serves as a structured log of my Python learning experience. I will be adding:
- 📖 **Notes & Tutorials**: Key concepts and explanations.
- 📝 **Practice Exercises**: Code snippets and problem-solving exercises.
- 🔨 **Mini Projects**: Small projects to apply what I've learned.
- 📊 **Challenges & Solutions**: Solving Python coding challenges.

## 📚 Learning Roadmap
Here’s a breakdown of my Python learning journey:

### ✅ **Phase 1: Python Basics**
- [ ] Understanding Python syntax and variables
- [ ] Control structures (if-else, loops)
- [ ] Functions and modules
- [ ] Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)

### 🚀 **Phase 2: Intermediate Python**
- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] File handling and data manipulation
- [ ] Exception handling and debugging
- [ ] Working with APIs and web scraping

### 💡 **Phase 3: Advanced Python & Projects**
- [ ] Data analysis with Pandas and NumPy
- [ ] Web development with Flask/Django
- [ ] Automation scripts
- [ ] Machine learning basics with Scikit-learn

## 🎯 Goals
- Maintain consistency in learning and coding daily.
- Build real-world projects to reinforce my understanding.
- Share insights and progress with the community.
