# Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

# Python provides several types of operators:

# Arithmetic Operators - Used to perform mathematical operations
# Example: +, -, *, /, %, **, //

   # Addition: x + y (Adds two numbers)
   # Subtraction: x - y (Subtracts two numbers)
   # Multiplication: x * y (Multiplies two numbers)
   # Division: x / y (Divides two numbers)
   # Modulus: x % y  (Returns the remainder of the division)
   # Exponentiation: x ** y (Returns x raised to the power of y)
   # Floor Division: x // y  (Returns the integer part of the division)




# Assignment Operators
  # Used to assign values to variables
    # Example: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
    
      # x = 5 (Assigns the value 5 to x)
        # x += 3 (Adds 3 to x)
        # x -= 3 (Subtracts 3 from x)
        # x *= 3 (Multiplies x by 3)
        # x /= 3 (Divides x by 3)
        # x %= 3 (Assigns the remainder of x divided by 3 to x)
        # x **= 3 (Raises x to the power of 3)
        # x //= 3 (Assigns the integer part of x divided by 3 to x)
        
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators
