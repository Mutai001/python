# Data strustures are used to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
# Python provides several built-in data structures:

# Data Structure	Example	Description
# list	        fruits = ["apple", "banana"]	        Ordered, mutable collection
# tuple	        point = (4, 5)	                    Ordered, immutable collection
# dict	        person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}	Key-value pair storage
