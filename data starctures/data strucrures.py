# Data strustures are used to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
# Python provides several built-in data structures for handing and managing data efficiently.

#Data structures can be classified into two categories:
# 1. Primitive Data Structures  - These are the basic data structures that directly operate upon the machine instructions.


# Data Structure	Example	Description
# list	        fruits = ["apple", "banana"]	        Ordered, mutable collection
# tuple	        point = (4, 5)	                    Ordered, immutable collection
# dict	        person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}	Key-value pair storage
